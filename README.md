...

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create booking"

If you see this error without a specific reason:

1. **Restart the server**: Stop the terminal (`Ctrl+C`) and run `npm run dev` again. This ensures all backend changes are loaded.
2. **Check required fields**: Ensure you've entered a name and valid time.

### UI Buttons are invisible or white

This usually happens if Tailwind configuration is missing.

- Ensure `tailwind.config.ts` exists in your root directory.
- Restart the dev server to pick up style changes.

### 🎨 Beautiful UI

- **Light mode design** - Clean, modern interface
- **Smooth animations** - Polished micro-interactions
- **Accessible** - Keyboard navigable with proper ARIA labels
